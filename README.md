# Peer to Peer System (P2P)

This system was developed as a part of a Internet Protocols Course Project at NC State.  
Implemented a P2P system with centralized index (P2P-CI) for Downloading RFCs using Python.  

* Helped gain familiarity with network programming and the socket interface
* creating server processes that wait for connections
* creating client processes that contact a well-known server and exchange data over the Internet
* defining a simple application protocol and making sure that peers and server follow precisely the specifications for their side of the protocol in order to accomplish particular tasks
* creating and managing a centralized index at the server based on information provided by the peers,
* implementing a concurrent server that is capable of carrying out communication with multiple clients simultaneously
